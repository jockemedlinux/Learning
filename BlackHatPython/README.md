All the nifty little thing from the book BlackHatPython

    Variables: Used to store data or values, which can be of different types such as integers, strings, and booleans.

    Functions: A block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to break down the code into smaller and reusable parts.

    Classes: A blueprint for creating objects. Classes define the properties and behavior of objects.

    Methods: Functions defined in a class are called methods. Methods are used to define the behavior of objects.

    Modules: A file containing Python definitions and statements. Modules are used to organize code into separate and reusable parts.

    Packages: A collection of modules that are grouped together into a single directory. Packages are used to organize code into even larger and reusable parts.

    Exceptions: An error that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are used to handle errors and ensure that the program continues to run even if an error occurs.

    Comments: Text in a program that is ignored by the interpreter. Comments are used to explain code and make it easier to understand.

    Iterators: An object that produces a sequence of values. Iterators are used to loop over a sequence of values.

    Generators: A type of iterator that generates values on-the-fly. Generators are used to create iterators in a more concise and memory-efficient way.
